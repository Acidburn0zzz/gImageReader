High prio:
- Fix TWAIN

Mid prio:
- Option to disable scanning (especially on windows, since twain causes problems. Or use WIA?)
- Add "insert file" button in output pane

Low prio:
- installation of tesseract langpacks through packagekit?
- text on image: check whether tesseract is able to provide me sufficient metrics for properly scaling and aligning the output text within the source image


Gtk:
- ReplacementManger::openList: m_currentFile empty, initial dir is garbage
- ScannerSane.hh::doCompletePage: clear is called too early

Qt:
- detect pdf from content type when using Qt5?
- check whether translations work
