High prio:
- Fix TWAIN

Mid prio:
- Option to disable scanning (especially on windows, since twain causes problems. Or use WIA?)
- Add "insert file" button in output pane
- User dictionary is not saved on some windows versions?

Low prio:
- installation of tesseract langpacks through packagekit?
- text on image: check whether tesseract is able to provide me sufficient metrics for properly scaling and aligning the output text within the source image


Gtk:
- clearing sources list does not unwatch items?
- OutputManager::saveBuffer: if there is no selected source, output filename is probably garbage
- ReplacementManger::openList: m_currentFile empty, initial dir is garbage
- ScannerSane.hh::doCompletePage: clear is called too early

Qt:
- crash handler
- command line parameters
- detect pdf from content type when using Qt5?
- check whether translations work
