High prio:
- Fix TWAIN

Mid prio:
- output pane always visible
- multiple recognition languages (i.e. "+" on tesseract commandline)
- text2image
- Left click to add selection, right click in the empty space to remove them?
- Don't set whole window to inactive when loading page, just display a "working" image and queue the rendering operation. If another rendering request comes in, cancel the active one.
- Fix backtrace window on windows (spawn async?)
- output pane in separate window
- User dictionary is not saved on some windows versions?

Low prio:
- installation of tesseract langpacks through packagekit?
- text on image: check whether tesseract is able to provide me sufficient metrics for properly scaling and aligning the output text within the source image
- replace all (how to integrate it in the UI?)

-> Remove the need for the Glib::SPAWN_DEFAULT patch
-> Update manual for latest features
