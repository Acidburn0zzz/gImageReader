High prio:
- notifier web links do not work?
- replace all
- insensitive when busy?

Low prio:
- markers in buffer to find corresponding page from cursor position
- blur downscaled -> this should really be fixed in cairoy

Cleanup:
- const in private member functions?


win32: uninstall previous version during setup
win32: twain, papersize
