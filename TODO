High prio:
- Fix TWAIN
- possible crash when source is removed when scale time is active since m_source is invalid when timer elapses?

Mid prio:
- Option to disable scanning (especially on windows, since twain causes problems. Or use WIA?)

Low prio:
- installation of tesseract langpacks through packagekit?
- text on image: check whether tesseract is able to provide me sufficient metrics for properly scaling and aligning the output text within the source image

Qt:
- detect pdf from content type when using Qt5?
- check whether translations work
